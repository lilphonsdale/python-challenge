Analyzing financial reports and voting data with python

There are two scripts, one for the budget_data.csv data set and one for the election_data.csv data set

The PyBank script reads the csv file and uses for loops to pull the data into lists. A conditional allows us to calcualte the changes from month to month and build a new list with them. A funciton is defined to take the average of that list. Zipping the lists together allows us to find the max and min changes.

The PyPoll script reads the csv file and uses for loops to pull the data into lists. Then conditionals and variables are used to count the votes by candidate and caluclate the vote share. Zipping lists together allows us to identify the candidate with the greatest number of votes. 

Both scripts print the results of the analysis into the terminal and also a txtfile, called output
